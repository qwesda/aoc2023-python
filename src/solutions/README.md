#  Directory for solution python files

- the solution files should be placed either in the `stan` or `qwesda` subdirectory
- the filenames should follow this pattern: `day_01a.py`, `day_01b.py`, `day_02a.py`, `day_02b.py`, ...
- the basic file structure is as follows:

```python
def get_problem_answer(input_data: list[str]) -> str:
    # data processing here

    return ''
```
- you can copy the solution template from `src/solutions/day_template.py`
